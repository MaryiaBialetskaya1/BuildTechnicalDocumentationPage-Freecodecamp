            <article>
                <p>Classes are the most fundamental of C#'s types. A class is a data structure that combines state (fields) and actions (methods and other function members) in a single unit. A class provides a definition for instances of the class, also known as objects. Classes support inheritance and polymorphism, mechanisms whereby derived classes can extend and specialize base classes.</p>
                <p>New classes are created using class declarations. A class declaration starts with a header. The header specifies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The attributes and modifiers of the class</li>
                    <li>The name of the class</li>
                    <li>The base class (when inheriting from a base class)</li>
                    <li>The interfaces implemented by the class</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The header is followed by the class body, which consists of a list of member declarations written between the delimiters { and }.</p>
                <p>
                    The following code shows a declaration of a simple class named Point:
                    <code>
                        public class Point
                        {
                            public int X { get; }
                            public int Y { get; }
                            public Point(int x, int y) => (X, Y) = (x, y);
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instances of classes are created using the new operator, which allocates memory for a new instance, invokes a constructor to initialize the instance, and returns a reference to the instance. The following statements create two Point objects and store references to those objects in two variables:
                    <code>
                        var p1 = new Point(0, 0);
                        var p2 = new Point(10, 20);
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>The memory occupied by an object is automatically reclaimed when the object is no longer reachable. It's not necessary or possible to explicitly deallocate objects in C#.</p>
