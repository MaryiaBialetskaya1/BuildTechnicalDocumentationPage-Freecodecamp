            <header>Classes and objects</header>
            <article>
                <p>Classes are the most fundamental of C#'s types. A class is a data structure that combines state (fields) and actions (methods and other function members) in a single unit. A class provides a definition for instances of the class, also known as objects. Classes support inheritance and polymorphism, mechanisms whereby derived classes can extend and specialize base classes.</p>
                <p>New classes are created using class declarations. A class declaration starts with a header. The header specifies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The attributes and modifiers of the class</li>
                    <li>The name of the class</li>
                    <li>The base class (when inheriting from a base class)</li>
                    <li>The interfaces implemented by the class</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The header is followed by the class body, which consists of a list of member declarations written between the delimiters { and }.</p>
                <p>
                    The following code shows a declaration of a simple class named Point:
                    <code>
                        public class Point
                        {
                            public int X { get; }
                            public int Y { get; }
                            public Point(int x, int y) => (X, Y) = (x, y);
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instances of classes are created using the new operator, which allocates memory for a new instance, invokes a constructor to initialize the instance, and returns a reference to the instance. The following statements create two Point objects and store references to those objects in two variables:
                    <code>
                        var p1 = new Point(0, 0);
                        var p2 = new Point(10, 20);
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>The memory occupied by an object is automatically reclaimed when the object is no longer reachable. It's not necessary or possible to explicitly deallocate objects in C#.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Type_parameters">
            <header>Type parameters</header>
            <article>
                <p>Generic classes define type parameters. Type parameters are a list of type parameter names enclosed in angle brackets. Type parameters follow the class name. The type parameters can then be used in the body of the class declarations to define the members of the class. In the following example, the type parameters of Pair are TFirst and TSecond:
                    <code>
                        public class Pair<TFirst, TSecond>
                            {
                                public TFirst First { get; }
                                public TSecond Second { get; }
                                public Pair(TFirst first, TSecond second) =>
                                (First, Second) = (first, second);
                            }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A class type that is declared to take type parameters is called a generic class type. Struct, interface, and delegate types can also be generic. When the generic class is used, type arguments must be provided for each of the type parameters:
                    <code>
                        var pair = new Pair<int, string>(1, "two");
                        int i = pair.First;     //TFirst int
                        string s = pair.Second; //TSecond string
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A generic type with type arguments provided, like Pair<int,string> above, is called a constructed type.
